## Credit Card Fraud Detection

## DATASET DESCRIPTION

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

**Welcome to our second big blue data academy project</strong>!**

- Our goal was to predict wheather a transaction is fraud or not using machine learning

Each one of the teamates uploaded his own code

-In stefsek u will find the code on which adaboost,xgboost and lightgbm classifiers are compared

-In gsylas u will find the code on which logistic regression,decistion tree and random forest classifiers are compared
